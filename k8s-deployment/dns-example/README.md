## Objective
Here we are trying to create two namespaces. 
- In the first namespace, we are creating a pod and a service. 
- In the second namespace, we will create a pod (in real life it can a database or web server). 
- After this we will try to access the service from the pod hosted in the second namespace. The important part to remember here is, both the pods should have the same label as the label of the service.
This will demonstrate that the DNS gets created by default when the service gets created and other pods from other namespaces can also access the service.

## Commands

### Create the namespaces
```
kubectl create ns first-ns
kubectl create ns second-ns
kubectl get ns
```

### Create the pods
```
kubectl apply -f pod1.yaml -n first-ns
kubectl apply -f pod2.yaml -n second-ns

kubectl get pods --all-namespaces // to get the pods all the namespaces
kubectl get pods -A // to get the pods all the namespaces``
```

### Create the service
```
kubectl apply -f service.yaml -n first-ns
kubectl get service -w -n first-ns

```

### to get inside of a pod
```
kubectl exec <pod name> -c <container name> -n <namespace name> -it bash
kubectl exec first-pod -c sample-container-1 -n first-ns -it bash
```

### To view the output in the browser
```
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```
- copy the internal IP of the node _eg 192.168.59.101_
- `<internal IP>:<nodePort port number>` _eg. 192.168.59.101:32000_
- paste it to the browser to see the result

### clean the cluster

```
kubectl delete pods pod1 -n svc
```

```
kubectl delete pods pod2 -n svc
```
```
kubectl delete service/myservice -n svc
```
```
kubectl delete namespace first-ns
```
```
kubectl delete ns second-ns
```
