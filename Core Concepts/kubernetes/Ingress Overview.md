# Ingress Overview


# Kubernetes Ingress Overview

Accessing applications from outside a Kubernetes cluster is essential for serving users at scale. Kubernetes uses an abstraction called **Ingress** to route external HTTP/HTTPS traffic to services within the cluster. By defining hostname- and path-based rules, Ingress acts as a reverse proxy or load balancer, enabling:

- Multiple services under a single IP
- SSL/TLS termination at the edge
- Name-based virtual hosting

> Note: Creating an Ingress resource has **no effect** until you deploy an **Ingress Controller**, which watches those resources and configures the edge component (e.g., NGINX or a cloud load balancer) to implement your routing rules.

Ingress Controllers run as Pods in your cluster, providing scalability and self-healing. Many offer SSL/TLS termination, authentication, and DNS integration.

## Popular Ingress Controllers

| Controller                 | Features                                      |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| NGINX Ingress Controller  | Widely adopted, rich annotation support       |
| Traefik                   | Dynamic configuration, Let's Encrypt support  |
| HAProxy Ingress           | High performance, advanced routing rules      |

Cloud platforms like AWS, GKE, and AKS also provide **managed controllers** that integrate with their load balancers and DNS services.

## Ingress vs. Service

| Aspect            | Service (NodePort/LoadBalancer) | Ingress                         |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Protocols         | TCP/UDP, HTTP                    | HTTP/HTTPS only                 |
| Port Exposure     | Arbitrary ports                  | Ports 80 and 443               |
| Routing           | None                             | Host- and path-based            |
| TLS Termination   | Not supported                    | Built-in at the edge            |
| Virtual Hosting   | No                               | Name-based                      |

## Key Ingress Concepts

1. **Ingress Rules**: Map hostnames and URL paths to specific services and ports.
2. **Default Backend**: Handles requests that don't match any rule.
3. **Resource Backend**: References another Kubernetes resource instead of a service.
4. **Path Types**:

   | Path Type            | Behavior                          |
   |----------------------|-----------------------------------|
   | Exact                | Matches the full path exactly     |
   | Prefix               | Matches based on the URL prefix   |
   | ImplementationSpecific | Controller-defined logic         |

5. **Annotations**: Enable controller-specific features like SSL redirection, URL rewrites, or rate limiting.
6. **TLS Configuration**: Uses Kubernetes Secrets to store certs/keys for HTTPS.

### Example Ingress YAML
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
  namespace: default
spec:
  defaultBackend:
    service:
      name: default-service
      port:
        number: 80
  rules:
  - host: "example.com"
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /web
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: web-service
            port:
              number: 80
```
> All traffic not matching `/web` is sent to `default-service:80`.

## Common Ingress Patterns

- **Single-Service Ingress**: Routes all traffic to one backend.
- **Simple Fan-Out**: Path-based routing to multiple services.
- **Name-Based Virtual Hosting**: Hostname-based routing for multiple domains.
- **TLS/SSL Termination**: Decrypts HTTPS at the edge and forwards HTTP to services.

Benefits:
- Centralized traffic management through a single entry point
- Simplified certificate handling with edge SSL/TLS termination
- Flexible path- and host-based routing
- Auto-scaling and high availability
- Native integration with cloud load balancers and DNS

## Ingress Resource vs Ingress Controller

| Aspect              | Ingress Resource                             | Ingress Controller                              |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Definition          | Kubernetes object for routing rules           | Component (Pod) that reads Ingress objects       |
| Functionality       | Declares host/path rules                      | Implements rules, load-balances traffic          |
| Runtime             | No running process                            | Runs inside cluster                              |
| Benefit             | No effect without a controller                | Routes external traffic to Services              |

## Kubernetes Architecture with Ingress

Clients send HTTP(S) requests to the clusterâ€™s external endpoint. The Ingress controller intercepts these requests, matches them against Ingress rules, and forwards them to the appropriate Service, which then load-balances to the backend Pods.

## Cloud-based Ingress Controllers

| Controller                 | Cloud Provider | Key Features                                      |
|---------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| AWS Load Balancer Controller | AWS           | ALB & NLB provisioning, Auto scaling              |
| Google Cloud Load Balancer   | GCP           | GKE integration, Global load balancing            |
| Azure Application Gateway    | Azure         | SSL termination, WAF, path-based routing          |

**Key Benefits**:
- Automatic provisioning of cloud LoadBalancer resources
- Built-in security features (WAF, IAM integration)
- Managed upgrades and high availability
- Reduced operational overhead

## Non-cloud-based Ingress Controllers

| Controller              | Use Case          | Highlights                                       |
|-------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| NGINX Ingress Controller | General purpose   | Reverse proxy, SSL/TLS, rate-limiting            |
| Traefik                 | Dynamic auto-config | HTTP/HTTPS routing, metrics, dashboard         |
| HAProxy Ingress         | Performance-focused | Low-latency load balancing, TCP support         |

> Requires exposing the controller using a `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort` service.

## Deployment Models: Deployment vs DaemonSet

| Option      | Pros                                                      | Cons                                         |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Deployment  | Dynamic scaling, resource-efficient                      | Uneven load distribution on nodes            |
| DaemonSet   | One Pod per node, uniform traffic distribution, high availability | Higher resource usage per node count |

**Use `Deployment`** when traffic patterns fluctuate and you want to optimize resource usage.  
**Use `DaemonSet`** for uniform low-latency ingress on every node and built-in failover.

## Factors to Consider

Before selecting an Ingress controller or deployment model, evaluate:

- Traffic volume, throughput, and latency requirements
- Scaling capabilities (static vs dynamic)
- Features: supported protocols, SSL/TLS, middleware (auth, rate limiting)
- Integration with your cloud or on-prem infrastructure
- Configuration complexity and learning curve
- API/automation support for CI/CD integration
- Community support, plugin ecosystem, and commercial options
- Cost: managed service fees vs self-managed resource costs
- High availability, failover strategies, and load balancing algorithms
