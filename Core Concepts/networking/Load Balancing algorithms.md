# Load balancing algorithms
Choosing the right load balancing algorithm is very important to ensuring your application remains scalable, reliable, and efficient.

| Sr | Load Balancing Method | Description |
|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Round robin | It distributes requests sequentially between servers, ensuring equitable distribution. Despite its simplicity, it does not account for server load, which might be a drawback when demand changes significantly. <br/>|
| 2 | Weighted round-robin | Improves round robin by assigning requests based on server capacity, aiming to better utilize resources by allocating more requests to higher-capacity servers. This approach seeks to optimize resource use, though actual results can vary with request complexity and system conditions. <br/>|
| 3 | Random | Implements a simple way of distributing requests regardless of server load or capability. This form of load distribution is basic, less precise, and suitable for simpler applications. <br/>|
| 4 | IP hash | Uses a consistent hashing method depending on the client's IP address to route requests. This technique is one way to ensure session persistence by consistently directing requests from the same client to the same server. <br/>|
| 5 | Least connections | Intelligently sends requests to the server with the fewest active connections, adapting to changing loads. This technique aims to reflect current server utilization better, potentially leading to more efficient resource consumption. <br/>| 
| 6 | Weighted Least Connections | Combines the benefits of Least Connections and Weighted Round Robin, considering both server load and capacity. <br/>|
| 7 | Least Bandwidth | Sends requests to the server consuming the least amount of network bandwidth <br/>|
| 8 | Least response time | Targets performance by routing requests to the server with the quickest response time. By considering both current server load and performance, this technique supports faster processing, potentially reducing response times for users |
