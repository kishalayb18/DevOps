# Fully Zero Trust

## Data Security
- Data encryption: Data should be encrypted during at rest(in db, storage) and in transit(bw services)
- Data loss prevention (DLP): DLP measure should be in place to prevent sensitive data from leaving your controlled premises
- Access Control List: Access Control List should be appropriately configured on all data stores (Cloud storage, database) to limit access to authorized users and services

## Application Security
- Secure Coding Practices: Secure coding practices followed to prevent vulnerabilities in application code. Regular code review and security testing is required.
- Authentication and Authorization: Robust application authentication and authorization mechanism in place within the application to control access to its functionality. Beyond service account authentication, there could be other access points needing protection (API gateway, apigee)
- Vulnerability Scanning: Regular vulnerability scans should be performed on the application code and dependencies.
- Penetration Testing: This should be performed to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Infrastructure Security
- The GCP resources should have least privilege access.
- Secret management should be there with services like Secret Manager. Secrets should be encryptes at rest, in transit.
- Logging and monitoring should be part of the security layer to capture suspicious activities, this should notify potential vulnerabilities.
- Regular Security Audits should be in place to identify whether good security posture is maintained and potental weakness.
- Network Segmentation based on business must be present as the foundation layer of secure infrastructure.
- Firewall Rules must be strict and allowing only necessary traffics. This has to be reviewed by security team.
- Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS) solution must be deployed to monitor network traffic and detect/prevent suspicious activities.

## Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Principal of least privilege is crucial. Evert user, service accounts, workloads should have minimum necessary permissions.
- Multi factored authentication should be in place to access the GCP resources.
- Regular IAM reviews helps to maintain access and permissions standards.

## Supply Chain Security
- Software Composition Analysis tools analyze dependendies and vulnerabilities of the application and stops the potential risks that might be generated by the third party libraries.
- Secure SDLC life cycle should be ensured by he secure coding practices, code reviews, automated testing, and vulnerability scanning throughout the process.
- Secure Image with the vulnerability scanning before pushing to the registry.

## Runtime Security
- Runtime Application Self Protection (RASP) solution detects and stops attacks during application run.
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system should be integrate to collect and analyze security logs from various sources, anabling threat detection and incident response.
- Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tools continuously monitor the cloud environment security posture.

## Advanced Threat Protection
- Threat Intelligence 
- Behavioural Analytics
- Endpoint Detection and Response

## Disaster Recovery and Business Continuty
- Data Backup and Disaster Recovery mechanism ensures business reliability and availability
- Incident Response Plan handles the security incidents effectively.
- Regular Disaster Recovery Drills should be conducted to verify the secondary infrastructure readiness.

## Policy and Governance
- The Zero Trust Guidelines should be Documented the policies, responsibilities, procedures.
- Security Awareness Training to educate team with the best practices and make them familiar with threats and the resolution path
- The Industry Regulation and Compliance should be met with the requirements like _PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR_

## Fully Zero Trust with GCP
1. Workload Identity Federation: This is a core component of Zero Trust, this eliminates direct access to Service account keys, which reduces the threat of credential compromise and enhancing security.

2. Zero Trust VPC Network: The VPC network with strict firewall rules and micro segmentation is fundamental of zero trust approach. This way the potential breach and the blast radius get limited. Private Service Connect (PSC) for internal communication further strengthens the zro trust posture.

3. Least Privilege IAM Roles: The principal of least privilege should be applied to all service accounts, groups, the granular permission and restricting broad access is to maintain security practices.
