#  Load Balancers
Load Balancers has s their adaptability to different networking environments. They can be configured to operate in either an internal (private) or Internet-facing (public) mode, allowing users to tailor their load balancing solutions to specific networking requirements

## Application Load Balancer
Application Load Balancers (ALBs) play a crucial role in distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure optimal resource utilization, high availability, and improved application performance. In this blog post, we will explore various use cases and key features of Application Load Balancers

### Example Use Cases

#### 1. Web Application Scaling
**Scenario** : Your web application is experiencing increased traffic due to a marketing campaign or sudden popularity.
**Use Case** : ALBs distribute incoming HTTP/HTTPS traffic across multiple EC2 instances, ensuring efficient handling of requests and preventing any single server from becoming a bottleneck.

#### 2. Microservices Architecture
**Scenario** : You have adopted a microservices architecture with different services running on separate containers or instances.
**Use Case** : ALBs support routing requests to different services based on contentbased routing or host-based routing, enabling efficient microservices communication 

#### 3. SSL/TLS Termination
**Scenario** : Your application requires secure communication using SSL/TLS.
**Use Case** : ALBs can handle SSL/TLS termination, offloading the decryption process from backend servers and simplifying the SSL certificate management

#### 4. Containerized Environments
**Scenario** : Your application is deployed in containers using services like VMs or Kubernetes.
**Use Case** : ALBs seamlessly integrate with containerized environments, dynamically updating backend targets based on container health, ensuring efficient traffic distribution 

#### 5. WebSockets Support
**Scenario** : Your application uses real-time communication through WebSockets.
**Use Case** : ALBs can handle WebSocket traffic, ensuring persistent connections and low-latency communication between clients and servers
