# Kubernetes Deployment Strategies

### 1. Recreate Deployment
 - What: Terminates all old versions and then deploys the new version.
 - How: When scaling down the old pods to zero and scaling up the new ones.
 - Why: Simple but results in downtime, suitable for non-critical applications.

### 2. Blue-Green Deployment
 - What: Run two identical production environments, with one active (blue) and one idle (green).
 - How: Switch traffic to the green environment once the new version is deployed and verified.
 - Why: Minimal downtime and easy rollback, but requires double the resources.

### 3. Canary Deployment
 - What: Gradually shifts traffic from the old version to the new version.
 - How: Start with a small percentage of traffic to the new version and increase it over time.
 - Why: Allows for real-world testing with minimal risk, enabling quick rollback if issues arise.

### 4. Rolling Update
 - What: Incrementally updates pods with the new version without downtime.
 - How: Replaces old pods with new ones gradually.
 - Why: Ensures continuous availability but can be slower and more complex to manage.

## Advanced and Innovative Deployment Strategies:

### 1. Canary Releases with Dynamic Weighting
 - What: Instead of a simple traffic split, dynamically adjust traffic weights based on real-time performance metrics.
 - How: Integrate with service mesh solutions like Istio or Linkerd.
 - Why: Minimize risk and react swiftly to anomalies, ensuring safer deployments.

### 2. Shadow Deployment
 - What: Route a copy of real-time traffic to a new version without impacting end users.
 - How: Use tools like Istioâ€™s mirroring feature.
 - Why: Validate the performance and behavior of new changes in a production-like environment.

### 3. Feature Toggles with Kubernetes ConfigMaps
 - What: Deploy code with features turned off, and enable them using config maps without redeploying.
 - How: Manage feature flags through ConfigMaps and environment variables.
 - Why: Increase deployment flexibility and reduce the need for frequent redeploys.

### 4. A/B Testing Deployments
 - What: Serve different application versions to different user segments.
 - How: Use ingress controllers and service mesh to route user traffic based on specific criteria.
 - Why: Gather insights and data on which version performs better or achieves higher user engagement.

### 5. Immutable Deployments
 - What: Instead of updating existing deployments, create new ones every time.
 - How: Use unique tags for container images and manage routing through Kubernetes services.
 - Why: Simplifies rollback and ensures complete traceability.
