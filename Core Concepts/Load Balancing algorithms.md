# Load balancing algorithms
Choosing the right load balancing algorithm is very important to ensuring your application remains scalable, reliable, and efficient.

## Round robin
It distributes requests sequentially between servers, ensuring equitable distribution. Despite its simplicity, it does not account for server load, which might be a drawback when demand changes significantly.

## Random
Implements a simple way of distributing requests regardless of server load or capability. This form of load distribution is basic, less precise, and suitable for simpler applications.

## IP hash
Uses a consistent hashing method depending on the client's IP address to route requests. This technique is one way to ensure session persistence by consistently directing requests from the same client to the same server.

## Weighted round robin
Improves round robin by assigning requests based on server capacity, aiming to better utilize resources by allocating more requests to higher-capacity servers. This approach seeks to optimize resource use, though actual results can vary with request complexity and system conditions.

## Least connections
Intelligently sends requests to the server with the fewest active connections, adapting to changing loads. This technique aims to better reflect current server utilization, potentially leading to more efficient resource consumption.

## Least response time
Targets performance by routing requests to the server with the quickest response time. By considering both current server load and performance, this technique supports faster processing, potentially reducing response times for users.
